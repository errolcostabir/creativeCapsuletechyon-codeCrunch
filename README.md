[a Heroku Link](https://code-crunch.herokuapp.com/) <br/>

Tech Stack used: <br/>
For Tasks 1-6 Tech Stack used is Node JS and Express JS
<br/>
<br/>
## Note/Comments:
<br/>
Task 1-6 is implemented in Node JS and Express JS and hence one Github repository is made for tasks 1-6. Remaining Tasks are being implemented by my team mates in a separate language. Hence a separate link for the hosted url is also shared for tasks 1-6.
